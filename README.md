Game Development: Project Studio, SUMMER 2013B
==============

This is a repo for "Game Development: Project Studio," a project-engineering / game development course at New York University.

What do you need to know to make a video game? EVERYTHING. To that end, all students will learn "everything" -- a basic understanding of programming, visual art, and prototyping practices -- before specializing. We will emphasize technique, yes, but we will also look at theory and philosophy to help guide our practice and develop our games thoughtfully.
